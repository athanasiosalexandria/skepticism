        About Me
      </h1>

      <p>
        I am currently an undergraduate sophomore at the University of California, San Diego, where I am pursuing a B.A. in Classical Studies with a minor in Philosophy. I currently have senior standing and expect to graduate in the Spring or Summer of 2026. Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a JD-PhD Program and further my study of the Classics. As part of my studies, I will be conducting research on the interaction of Hellenistic Philosophy and early Christian asceticism through the Honors program of the UC San Diego Classics Department.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a student of the Classics, my interests include Latin, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic Philosophy, Early Christianity, Classical and Hellenistic Greek Antiquity, and the Roman Empire.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was born in Torrance, California. I spent part of my childhood in Greece before my family moved to Palos Verdes, California. I attended Palos Verdes High School, where I graduated as a member of National Honor Society, National English Honor Society, Spanish National Honor Society, California Scholarship Federation, and Tri-M Music Honor Society. I have lived in San Diego since 2023, when I moved to continue my studies at UC San Diego.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was raised bilingual and am fluent in English and Modern Greek, with limited proficiency in Latin and Spanish. I also have elementary reading proficiency in Ancient Greek.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a semi-professional clarinetist and have played the clarinet since childhood. From 2020â€“2023, I played as principal clarinetist for the Pacific Vision Youth Symphony (formerly the Asia America Youth Symphony) under conductor and jazz composer David Benoit, instructed by clarinetist Darryl Tanikawa. During the same time period, I was principal clarinetist for the Orchestra of Palos Verdes High School.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the same time period, I was President of the Luna Peak Links, a non-profit organization based out of Palos Verdes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy playing music, reading, exercising, and learning languages.
